Looking at the SVM training set, the accuracy is at about 0.68 where the test accuracy
is at about 0.45. Because the training data is so much higher than the test data, the data
was being overfitted.

With the KNN training and testing sets, the accuracy becomes closer and closer to each other
with the increasing k values. At k=0, the training set is at almost 100% accuracy and testing
is 32%. At k=5, around 0.52 for training and 0.48 for testing. At k=25, 0.4 for testing and
0.45 for training. This shows that as k goes up, the accuracy decreases and the data seems
to become more and more underfit.
